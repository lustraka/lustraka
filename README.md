## 📈 Data Science for Business
> *Where most mistakes come from?* Most mistakes don't come from low intelligence (even people with extreme raw intelligence make mistakes) neither they come from a lack of experience (even people with tons of experience make mistakes). **Mistakes come from what we can't see. Mistakes come from blind spots.** 

> *In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins.* It’s hard to make good decisions when you don’t have the facts. It’s hard to make good decisions when you’re solving the wrong problem. It’s hard to make good decisions when you’re missing key pieces of information. It’s hard to make good decisions without perspective. [[fscourses.com/decision-by-design](https://fscourses.com/p/decision-by-design)]

**Data science is not a panacea but something we cannot ignore without penalty** (though sometimes unseen).

## 🦸 Digital Freelancer Pattern Language
> The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. [A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, 1977]

Professionals worldwide choose freelancing as their preferred lifestyle thanks to the flexibility, healthy work-life balance, attractive earning potential
and freedom it provides. So, are you ready to embrace the the freelance movement and build yourself the solo career you've always wanted? This Digital Freelancer Pattern
Language aims to equip you with those tools and advise you need to thrive and survive, because well, it's a bit a jungle out there!

**A (design) pattern** has - at minimum - an initial context, a problem statement, an exploration of forces, a solution, and a resulting context.
+ *An initial context* describes a situation when the pattern could be applied.
+ *Problem statement* unfolds a gap in the initial context to be resolved.
+ *Forces* describe all aspects (constraints) to be balanced by a solution.
+ *The solution* expresses how to solve the problem by balancing most of the forces.
+ *A resulting context* takes account of those forces which have been balanced and those which remained unbalanced. The resulting context of one pattern can be an initial context of another one.

**Go from proposal to project**:
+ Select opportunitites that fit your experience
+ Look from the client's point of view
+ Customize your proposal
+ Stand out from the crowd
+ Be responsive
